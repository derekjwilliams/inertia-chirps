# inertia-chirps
Laravel Inertia Sandbox

This code is based on the Inertia Bootcamp found at https://bootcamp.laravel.com.  

The chirper folder contains the **non Docker (Sail)** version of that code.  This includes a couple of differences from the Bootcamp directions to correct a few small errors that may be related to some differences between the Docker version and the nonDocker version

The chirper-using-sail is a placeholder for the Docker incarnation if one chooses to go that route.  The differences are minimal.
